# Description

Hello there,

thank You for looking at **ατελής** (ateles), my second rice named after a Greek definition for *"imperfection"*. This piece took me tremendous amounts of time so I am really happy to finally use it for productive work even though it still has some bugs.

If You like my work You might want to take a look at my [dot-files](http://github.com/re1/dotfiles) which contain a huge variety of settings.Shared settings are located on the [master](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles) and those related to the window manager on [bspwm](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/bspwm) branches.

As You can see I am working on [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/) with [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as my window manager while using various independent applications. The first image with the caption *"Front"* features my Panel, System Monitor, Terminal and File Manager software. Have a short list of the most important components:

The second image shows a typical web-development set-up with [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/developer/) as IDE and browser. My JetBrains IDEs are styled using the [Material Theme](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) plug-in which can also be adjusted to any [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) theme with the [Base16 JetBrains](https://github.com/adilosa/base16-jetbrains) template.

As for smaller projects I really like the sidebar disabled inside the IDE which makes for a much cleaner look.

I would love to get some feedback so please do not be shy to leave a comment or even a pull request!
