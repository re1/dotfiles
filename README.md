Mostly configuration files with some eye candy for different window managers.

## Branches

Each branch contains configuration for different window managers and or working environments. <br />
[`master`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles) contains all common files without any relation to a specific branch (avoids deprecation).

- [`i3-xfce`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/i3-xfce)
- [`i3-gaps`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/i3-gaps)
- [`kde`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/i3-gaps)
- [`sway`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/sway)

I am currently working on [`bspwm`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/bspwm)!
