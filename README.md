This is the `bspwm` branch of [@re1](https://github.com/re1)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles) repository.

Each branch contains configuration for different window managers and or working environments. <br />
[`master`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles) contains all common files without any relation to a specific branch (avoids deprecation).
