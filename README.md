## Branches

Each branch contains configuration for different window managers and or working environments. <br />
[`master`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles) contains all common files without any relation to a specific branch (avoids deprecation). For now I am using [`bspwm`](https://github.com/re1/dotfiles/tree/bspwm) but other branches should work fine too!

## Contribution

If you like my dotfiles (and also if you hate them) you can create a pull request for specific files.
